This is a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) application with nothing else in it.

### What's in it?

Just a simple [index.jsx](./index.jsx), [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) and [index.html](./public/index.html) file.

### To run

Install:

```
> $ npm i webpack-dev-server webpack -g

```

You can simply run webpack build using this command:
