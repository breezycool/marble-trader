# react-webpack-babel
Simple React Webpack Babel Starter Kit


This is a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) application with nothing else in it.

### Get the repo

Make sure you do a recursive clone to get all the submodules.

```
> $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/breezycool/redux-learn
```

### To run

Install:

```
> $ npm i webpack-dev-server webpack -g
> $ npm install
```

Install submodules (just in case you didn't recursive clone this repo):

```
> $ git submodule init
> $ git submodule update
```

You can simply run webpack build using this command: 

```
> $ npm run build
```

If you want to run with webpack-dev-server simply run this command: 

```
> $ npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8080/`
